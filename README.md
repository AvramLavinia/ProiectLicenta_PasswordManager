# ProiectLicenta_PasswordManager

The Password Manager application provides a practical solution for managing passwords, allowing users to store passwords in a secure environment and access them in a convenient and protected manner. It enables users to generate new strong passwords, add secure notes, and verify the complexity of the passwords.
In the development of the Password Manager application, a multitude of cutting-edge technologies were employed to ensure a sophisticated and user-friendly experience. The client-side interface was meticulously crafted using React, a powerful JavaScript library renowned for its efficiency in rendering dynamic user interfaces. This, combined with the robust typing system of TypeScript, significantly enhanced the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

To elevate the aesthetic appeal and functionality of the user interface, CSS3 was utilized, enabling a polished and responsive design. The server-side operations were powered by Node.js, chosen for its exceptional performance and compatibility with JavaScript code, ensuring seamless server-side script execution.

For handling asynchronous HTTP requests, Axios was the tool of choice, streamlining the process of communicating with REST endpoints for various CRUD operations. Express, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, facilitated the construction of the application's APIs, contributing to a flexible and scalable server architecture.

A distinction was made between Axios, which specializes in HTTP requests, and Express, which is integral to API construction, highlighting the unique roles each plays within the project. Data management was entrusted to MSSQL, Microsoft's robust relational database management system, which was accessed and managed via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for optimal data administration.

TypeORM was integrated to interact with the MSSQL database using object-relational mapping, allowing for a more intuitive data handling experience that aligns with object-oriented programming principles. The state management for the front-end was handled by Redux, ensuring that the application's state was managed predictably and efficiently in a centralized store.

Furthermore, to facilitate email delivery functions within the application, SendGrid was implemented, offering reliable email services and enhancing the communication capabilities of the Password Manager.
